### Flask?
- Pros
    - Easy to get started
    - Very customized
    - Web Server Gateway Interface(WSGI) compatible
        - => can use any web server that is WSGI compatible
- Cons
    - Extremely limited --> have to build everything
    - No database help --> have to write custom SQL

==> **How much do I value customizing the project exactly how I like it?**
